# Sparkify Data Warehouse
FWD Data Engineering Nanodegree from Udacity project III.

## Overview
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables.

## Description
build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift, by load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

##  Dataset
* **Song Dataset**
    * The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json`
  
  *  below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like. 

     `{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}`

* **Log Dataset**
  * The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

    The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
     `log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json` 

    `log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json`

     below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Tables
**2 Staging Tables**
  1. staging events
  2. staging songs

 **Fact Table**

 * songplays : records in log data associated with song plays

**4 Dimension Tables**

1. users : users in the app
2. songs : songs in music database
3. artists : artists in music database
4. time : timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

## Files

1. `sql_queries.py` : contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the two others files below.

2. `create_tables.py` : drops and creates your tables.

3. `etl.py` : reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables.
